about = QMapPermalink enables creation and navigation of map view permalinks in QGIS through a dockable panel interface. Generate fixed links for specific map positions and complete map states including layer visibility, themes, and styles. Navigate directly from external documents (Excel, PDF) to precise map locations with full state restoration. The plugin also runs an embedded HTTP server that exposes both a dynamic WMS endpoint and an OpenLayers-based HTML endpoint ("/wms" and "/qgis-map"). This allows QGIS to act as a WMS server and to serve an interactive OpenLayers web map for browser-based viewing and remote navigation. Version 1.10.0 introduces a major milestone with fully functional OpenLayers web map integration, providing interactive browser-based map viewing with seamless QGIS coordinate system support. Features dedicated Google Maps and Google Earth buttons with real-world data calculations, and robust HTTP server architecture for reliable external service integration. Version 2.3.0 adds permalink support from the OpenLayers web map to Google Maps and Google Earth. Additional in v2.6.0: improved coordinate handling and display (座標管理).
