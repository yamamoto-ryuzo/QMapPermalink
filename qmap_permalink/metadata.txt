about = QMapPermalink enables creation and navigation of map view permalinks in QGIS through a dockable panel interface. Generate fixed links for specific map positions and view states (position, scale, rotation), then navigate directly from external documents (Excel, PDF) to precise map locations with a single click. Version 1.3.0 features a complete UI redesign with a left-docked panel that automatically tabs with existing panels (Layers, Browser), full internationalization support, and streamlined workflow integration.
