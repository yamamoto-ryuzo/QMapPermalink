about = QMapPermalink enables creation and navigation of map view permalinks in QGIS through a dockable panel interface. Generate fixed links for specific map positions and complete map states including layer visibility, themes, and styles. Navigate directly from external documents (Excel, PDF) to precise map locations with full state restoration. The plugin also runs an embedded HTTP server that exposes dynamic WMS and OpenLayers endpoints ("/wms" and "/qgis-map"), and MapLibre integration (WMTS/WFS with QGIS-style injection via "/maplibre" and "/maplibre-style"). Version 1.10.0 introduces a major milestone with fully functional OpenLayers web map integration. Version 2.x extends MapLibre/WMTS support and high-zoom behavior. Version 3.0.0 stabilizes MapLibre WFS + style injection for high-fidelity vector rendering.
